# Bubble-sort-Assembly
> Explanation
 

Retrieve an element in accumulator.
Compare it with next element, if it is greater then swap otherwise move to next index.
If in one entire loop there has been no exchange, halt otherwise start the whole iteration again.
The following approach has two loops, one nested inside other so- 
Worst and Average Case Time Complexity: O(n*n). Worst case occurs when array is reverse sorted. 
Best Case Time Complexity: O(n). Best case occurs when array is already sorted.
